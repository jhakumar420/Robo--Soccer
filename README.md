# Robo--Soccer
RoboSoccer: A versatile bot designed for scoring goals autonomously, featuring Bluetooth modules and transmitter-receiver capabilities.
I developed three iterations of RoboSoccer, initially crafting a basic version utilizing switches and wires, powered by motors. By integrating two six-pin switches, I created a functional RoboSoccer prototype.
In the second phase, I upgraded the RoboSoccer bot by incorporating advanced components such as a Bluetooth controller (HC-05), Arduino Uno microcontroller, four motors, and an L298N motor driver and In the third phase, I further enhanced the RoboSoccer bot by implementing a transmitter and receiver setup. This iteration involved integrating a transmitter module to control the bot remotely, along with a receiver module for receiving commands. The addition of these components allowed for greater flexibility and control over the bot's movements.
The code for this enhanced version is detailed within this file.
